# CompTopoProg
This repository holds the logic for data analysis, modeling, and filtration generation for Stone Mele, and Torin McDonalds' Computation Topology 2019 project.

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict the growth, and decline of the sea ice density at our earths poles. Another goal for this project was
to find a novel way of interjecting the topological features into this process. We accomplished this with a combination of imaginative model architecture and the SLayer from Hofer et al paper. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04041)
